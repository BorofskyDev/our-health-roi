      <h3>NIH Impact Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Since 1985, public investment through the NIH has powered research into

      <h2>What To Do About It</h2>
      <p>
        If the above information has played an impact in your life or in the
        life of someone close to you, then you need the NIH. Don’t let
        billionaires or politicians slash that lifeline. Email and call your
        U.S. representative and both senators today; share your story, thank
        them for past support, and urge them to protect and grow NIH funding.
        Our personal message can keep the breakthroughs coming.

      <h2>Why The Above Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Since 1938 the National Institutes of Health has invested public dollars
        in research that keeps Americans - and the world - alive and thriving.

      <h2>Why The NIH Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Every year, a few pennies from each tax dollar you send to Washington go
        to the National Institutes of Health. It isn’t much - usually less than
        one percent of the federal budget. For most of us that works out to
        pocket change, only a few dollars a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet those small coins buy something priceless: time with family, second
        chances, and healthier lives. NIH grants have helped create vaccines,
        cancer drugs, insulin pumps, and even the bandages used in combat
        hospitals on our American military members. If you have ever taken a
        prescription, received a flu shot, or watched a love one beat an
        illness, odds are NIH-funded science played a part.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is an amazing return on investment (ROI). A handful of dollars
        becomes treatments worth billions - and hope worth far more. Private
        companies finish the job, but the hard, risky work often starts with
        public research dollars we pool together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paying taxes can feel like money lost. In truth, it is money shared.
        When we fund the NIH, we are betting on ourselves and on one another. We
        are saying that every American life is worth saving, whether that life
        sits next door or across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is patriotism as its best. Not waving a bigger flag or shouting the
        loudest, but quietly building a nation where cures keep coming and no
        solution is left undiscovered because it was too early, too hard, or not
        yet profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the next time you fill a prescription, cheer a cancer-free friend, or
        read about a new therapy, remember: you helped make it happen. A few
        dollars. A huge return. Our health ROI.
